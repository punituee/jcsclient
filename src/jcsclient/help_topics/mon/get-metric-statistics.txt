NAME :
    get-metric-statistics


DESCRIPTION :
    Fetches metric statistics for the given metric name
    and other parameters.

    For complete list of metrics and usage, refer to
    reference guide for monitoring APIs.

SYNOPSIS :
    get-metric-statistics
    --namespace <value>
    --metric-name <value>
    [--dimensions <value>]
    --start-time <value>
    --end-time <value>
    --period <value>
    --statistics <value>
    [--unit <value>]


OPTIONS :
    --namespace (string)
    The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.

    --metric-name (string)
    The name of the metric, with or without spaces.

    --dimensions (list)
    A list of dimensions describing qualities of the metric.
    Shorthand Syntax:
    Name=string,Value=string ...

    --start-time (timestamp)
    The time stamp to use for determining the first datapoint to return.
    The value specified is inclusive; results include datapoints with the
    time stamp specified. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format
    (e.g., 2014-09-03T23:00:00Z).
    "Note
    The specified start time is rounded down to the nearest value.
    Datapoints are returned for start times up to two weeks in the past.
    Specified start times that are more than two weeks in the past will
    not return datapoints for metrics that are older than two weeks.
    Data that is timestamped 24 hours or more in the past may take in
    excess of 48 hours to become available from submission time using
    get-metric-statistics."

    --end-time (timestamp)
    The time stamp to use for determining the last datapoint to return.
    The value specified is exclusive; results will include datapoints up
    to the time stamp specified. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format
    (e.g., 2014-09-03T23:00:00Z).

    --period (integer)
    The granularity, in seconds, of the returned datapoints.
    period must be at least 60 seconds and must be a multiple of 60.
    The default value is 60.

    --statistics (list)
    The metric statistics to return. For information about specific statistics
    returned by GetMetricStatistics, see statistics in the JioCloudServices
    Monitoring Developer Guide .
    Syntax:
    "string" "string" ...
    Where valid values are:
        SampleCount
        Average
        Sum
        Minimum
        Maximum

    --unit (string)
    The unit for the metric.
    Possible values:
        Seconds
        Microseconds
        Milliseconds
        Bytes
        Kilobytes

        Bits
        Kilobits
        Megabits
        Gigabits
        Terabits
        Percent
        Count
        Bytes/Second

        Count/Second
        None
