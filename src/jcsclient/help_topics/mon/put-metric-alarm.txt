NAME :
    put-metric-alarm


DESCRIPTION:
    Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with
    the specified JCS monitoring metric; allowing actions
    to be taken on the associated instance(s) such as 
    sending email notifications, executing scaling policies 
    or even corrective measures such as stop/reboot/terminate 
    instance as soon as the metric values are breached and 
    the alarm is raised.

    When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state
    is immediately set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA . The alarm is
    evaluated and its StateValue is set appropriately.
    Any actions associated with the StateValue is then executed.

OPTIONS :
    --alarm-name (string)
    The descriptive name for the alarm. This name must be
    unique within the user's JCS account

    --alarm-description (string)
    The description for the alarm.

    --actions-enabled (boolean)
    Indicates whether or not actions should be
    executed during any changes to the alarm's state.

    --ok-actions (list)
    The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions
    into an OK state from any other state. Each action is specified
    as an JCS Resource Name (JRN).
    Syntax:
    "string" "string" ...

    --alarm-actions (list)
    The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into
    an ALARM state from any other state. Each action is specified
    as an JCS Resource Name (ARN).
    Syntax:
    "string" "string" ...

    --insufficient-data-actions (list)
    The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions
    into an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. Each
    action is specified as an JCS Resource Name (ARN).
    Syntax:
    "string" "string" ...

    --metric-name (string)
    The name for the alarm's associated metric.

    --namespace (string)
    The namespace for the alarm's associated metric.

    --statistic (string)
    The statistic to apply to the alarm's associated metric.
    Possible values:
        SampleCount
        Average
        Sum
        Minimum
        Maximum

    --dimensions (list)
    The dimensions for the alarm's associated metric.
    Shorthand Syntax:
    Name=string,Value=string ...

    --period (integer)
    The period in seconds over which the specified statistic is applied.

    --unit (string)
    The statistic's unit of measure. For example, the units for the
    JCS EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks
    the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces.
    You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help
    provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify
    a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately.
    Note: If you specify a unit, you must use a unit that is appropriate
    for the metric. Otherwise, this can cause an JCS monitoring alarm
    to get stuck in the INSUFFICIENT DATA state.
    Possible values:
        Seconds
        Microseconds
        Milliseconds
        Bytes
        Kilobytes
        Megabytes
        Gigabytes
        Terabytes
        Bits
        Kilobits
        Megabits
        Gigabits
        Terabits
        Percent
        Count
        Bytes/Second
        Kilobytes/Second
        Megabytes/Second
        Gigabytes/Second
        Terabytes/Second
        Bits/Second
        Kilobits/Second
        Megabits/Second
        Gigabits/Second
        Terabits/Second
        Count/Second
        None

    --evaluation-periods (integer)
    The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

    --threshold (double)
    The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

    --comparison-operator (string)
    The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold.
    The specified statistic value is used as the first operand.
    Possible values:
        GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold
        GreaterThanThreshold
        LessThanThreshold
        LessThanOrEqualToThreshold
