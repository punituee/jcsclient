    This method makes the actual request to JCS services. 
    The steps are:
        1. Create an AuthHandler object to add signature to the request.
        2. Add any common headers to request like Content.
        3. Use requests library to send the requests to JCS service.

    Benefit ot AuthHandler class is that we can modify the Signature
    generation mechanism under the hood.
